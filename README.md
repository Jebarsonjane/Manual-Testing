Manual Testing

1) SDLC Flow chart:
            SDLC (Software Development Life cycle) , It is a entire process of formal and logical steps  taken to develop a software product.
Flow chart:

2)Difference between Quality assurance and Quality control:

Quality Assurance: Measures the quality of  process to create a quality product, QA makes sure that we are developing a right product.

Quality control: Measures the quality of product, QC makes sure that we are developed right product.

3)SRS & LLD:
SRS stands for System Resource Specification, SRS contains two types of sub documents,
*FRS -Functional resource specification.
*NFS -Non functional resource specification

LLD: LLD: Low Level Design document defines the internal logic of corresponding module (or) functionality. The LLD is also known as Internal Logic Design document.


4) Manual Testing:
Manual Vs Automation Testing

A Test Engineer conducts a test on application build without using any third party testing tool is called Manual Testing.

A Tester conducts a test on application build with the help of a testing tool is called test Automation Testing.

5)LLD &HLD:
HLD: High Level Design document defines the overall architecture of the system from root functionalities to leaf functionalities. This HLD is also known as Architectural Design or External Design.

LLD: Low Level Design document defines the internal logic of corresponding module (or) functionality. The LLD is also known as Internal Logic Design document.

6)SRS:
SRS: Software requirement specification defines functional requirements to be developed and system requirement to be used (Hardware and Software).

7)STLC:
Software testing life cycle involves  test initiation,test plan, test case preparation  and execution.

8)Test strategy and Test plan:

Test Strategy:
It is also a company level document and developed by quality analyst people (project manager level). This strategy document defines testing approach to be followed by testing team
Test plan: A document that defines the overall testing approach is called test plan.

9)Test cases:
 Test cases are nothing but set of procedures which we execute in our system to find the defect.

Test strategy: A concept which provides the oneline information about what to test.

10) Test data:


11) Roles and responsibilities of Tester:
1) Analyzing the Requirements from the client
2) Participating in preparing Test Plans
3) Preparing Test Scenarios
4) Preparing Test Cases for module, integration and system testing
5) Preparing Test Data’s for the test cases
6) Preparing Test Environment to execute the test cases
7) Analyzing the Test Cases prepared by other team members
8) Executing the Test Cases
9) Defect Tracking

12) Defect life cycle:
It starts when defect is found and ends when a defect is closed,

13) Defered and Rejected states:
Rejected: If the developer feels that the bug is not genuine, he rejects the bug. Then the state of the bug is changed to “rejected”.
Deferred: The bug, changed to deferred state means the bug is expected to be fixed in next releases. The reasons for changing the bug to this state have many factors. Some of them are priority of the bug may be low, lack of time for the release or the bug may not have major efect on the software.

14) new and reopen states:
New:  When a defect is logged and posted for the first time. It’s state is given as new.
Reopen:  If the bug still exists even after the bug is fixed by the developer, the tester changes the status to “reopened”. The bug goes through the life cycle once again.

15) Levels of testing:
Unit testing: It is basically done by the developers to make sure that their code is working fine and meet the user specifications. They test their piece of code which they have written like classes, functions, interfaces and procedures.
 It follows white box testing.

Entry Criteria:
Business requirement document complete
software development plan approved
Environment set up
Build

Exit Criteria:
All major bugs are fixed.
Internal document is updated.

Integration testing: It is the process of combining all the modules and checking the interaction between them. Both developers and testers involve in this process.
It follows WBT & BBT.
ENTRY CRITERIA:
Unit testing is completed.
bugs are fixed.
Environment setup
Proper trainning is provided
Build

EXIT CRITERIA:
Major and minor bugs are fixed
Internal document is upodated.
